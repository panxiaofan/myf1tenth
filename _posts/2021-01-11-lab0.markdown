## Brief Notes
Since I have worked with ROS before, so I wouldn't expand too much on intro of ROS. After accomplishing lab 1 using both C++ and Python and going through all the written questions in the lab 1, I have the following notes:

* note 1:
  CmakeLists is a generator of build systems, it can produce MakeFiles; while Make(or rather MakeFiles) is a build system which drives the compiler and other build tools to build your code.
* note 2:
  source ~/overlay_ws/devel/setup.bash is to overlay your package in the overlay_ws workspace on top of the packages installed in /opt/ros/melodic. It is a good practice to check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH if errors like pakage not found was throwed.
* note 3:
  There is no spinOnce in rospy, only in roscpp
* note 4:
  There is no need to run catkin_make if you write the node in .py file. However, you need to make sure it is executable my using the command: chmod +x your_node.py
* note 5:
  If not  specified the path when using rosbag record, the files are saved under the default directory ~/.ros
* note 6:
  Using -o will output a bag file with the timestamp at the location you specify; Using -O will output a bag file without the timestamp at the location you specify  
* note 7:
  A good pratice for dealing with [LaserScan info](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0117.html)
